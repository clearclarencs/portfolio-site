            <h3><br />Freelance Software Development</h3>
            <b>I enjoy computer science specifically software development because it requires constant learning and self-improvement. I’ve been programming for around 3 years mostly in my spare time creating different projects and scripts using Python and most recently JavaScript. Most of my projects relate to the sneaker resale industry lots of which can be found on my GitHub page. Since becoming competent at software development especially within http requests within python I do occasional freelance software development, for small clients within the sneaker resale community (more information in hobbies), this involved a range of small scripts from website account generation, discord bots and I even started a business which is a provider of sneaker raffle links where I built a program which automatically scrapes sites and sends information to clients. This work allows me to expand my programming ability and portfolio by solving abstract problems and improving programming technique like error handling and maximising compute efficiency.</b>
            <h3><br />Homebase LLC Sales Associate</h3>
            <b>From summer 2019 to summer 2020 I worked as a sales associate at Homebase Store Market Harborough. This involved working as a team to provide expertise and friendly service to customers asewell as the commitment of a part-time job. Key skills required are punctuality, determination and hard-work.</b>
