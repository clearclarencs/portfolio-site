            <b>Since 2017 I have also been trading limited goods usually clothing and footwear which includes attempting to purchase the very limited item before they sell out then reselling onto consumers for a profit. This is due to the supply and demand being out of equalibrium and price must be raised to allow them to meet. I enjoy doing it as it requires constant learning and self improvement aswell as consisting of an amazing community of like-minded people.<br /></b>

This involved shadowing full-time traders which helped me to learn about how to trade, spotting trends in data and predicting what will happen to prices. This was an incredible experience learning how mathematical this process is and I am excited to pick it back up as I turn 18.</b>
